<#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Recursively discovers related Kaspa addresses by analyzing blockchain transaction inputs and outputs from a starting address.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
        This script performs recursive address discovery for the Kaspa cryptocurrency network. Starting from an initial address, it traverses the blockchain by extracting new addresses from transaction inputs and outputs.
        
        The script implements parallel processing through PowerShell jobs, allowing multiple address lookups to run concurrently within a configurable limit. This significantly improves performance when analyzing large transaction sets. Address discovery is controlled by a maximum depth parameter that limits how far the script will traverse from the initial address.
        
        The script continues processing until all discoverable addresses within the depth limit have been analyzed. Upon completion, it returns a complete set of all discovered addresses, which can be used for blockchain analysis, wallet clustering, or transaction flow mapping.

    .PARAMETER InitialAddress
        The starting address to begin processing from. This address is validated to ensure it is a valid Kaspa address.

    .PARAMETER TransactionLimit
        The maximum number of transactions to fetch per address when an address has more than 500 transactions and pagination is required. Defaults to 500 if not specified.

    .PARAMETER MaxDepth
        Specifies the maximum depth to which the script should traverse from the initial address. 
        A depth of 1 means only addresses directly connected to the initial address will be discovered.
        Each newly discovered address is assigned a depth one level deeper than the address it was found from.

        This parameter prevents the script from infinitely traversing deeply linked transactions 
        and helps control the scale and runtime of the address discovery process. Defaults to 1.
        
    .PARAMETER ConcurrencyLimit
        The maximum number of concurrent jobs to run for parallel processing. Higher values improve throughput on systems with adequate resources but may increase API load. Defaults to 5 if not specified.

    .PARAMETER MaxFailedTries
        The maximum number of retry attempts for addresses from failed jobs before abandoning processing. Provides resilience against temporary network or API issues. Defaults to 3 if not specified.

    .PARAMETER SkipInputs
        If specified, the script will skip processing transaction inputs and only discover addresses from outputs.

    .PARAMETER SkipOutputs
        If specified, the script will skip processing transaction outputs and only discover addresses from inputs.

    .PARAMETER CleanConsole
        An optional switch to clear the console screen before processing the addresses. 
        If this switch is provided, the console will be cleared at the beginning of the script execution.

    .EXAMPLE
        PS> .\discover-addresses.ps1 -InitialAddress "kaspa:abcd1234..." -TransactionLimit 100 -MaxDepth 3 -ConcurrencyLimit 10
        Starts address discovery with a limit of 100 transactions per address, maximum depth of 3, and up to 10 concurrent jobs.

    .EXAMPLE
        PS> .\discover-addresses.ps1 -InitialAddress "kaspa:abcd1234..." -CleanConsole
        Starts address discovery with the console cleared before execution.

    .EXAMPLE
        PS> .\discover-addresses.ps1 -InitialAddress "kaspa:abcd1234..." -CleanConsole -SkipInputs
        Starts address discovery from the specified address with default parameters, clears the console before execution, and only processes transaction outputs.

    .OUTPUTS
        Returns a custom PSCustomObject object with the following properties:
            - DiscoveredCount: The total number of unique addresses discovered
            - DiscoveredAddresses: A collection of all discovered addresses (System.Collections.Generic.ICollection[string])
            - FailedCount: The total number of addresses that failed processing after all retry attempts
            - FailedAddresses: A collection of addresses that could not be processed (System.Collections.Generic.ICollection[string])

    .NOTES
        The script uses PowerShell jobs for parallel processing to improve performance.
